	abstract = {Objective: It is a notable step to be taken in constructing important software testing environment so that a system's commercial value can increase. The main idea of this review is to examine and classify the current test case prioritization approaches based on the articulated research questions.
Method: Set of search keywords with appropriate repositories were utilized to extract most important studies that fulfill all the criteria defined and classified under journal, conference paper, symposiums and workshops categories. 69 primary studies were nominated from the review strategy.
Results: There were 40 journal articles, 21 conference papers, three workshop articles, and five symposium articles collected from the primary studies. As for the result, it can be said that TCP approaches are still broadly open for improvements. Each approach in TCP has specified potential values, advantages, and limitation. Additionally, we found that variations in the starting point of TCP process among the approaches provide a different timeline and benefit to project manager to choose which approaches suite with the project schedule and available resources.
Conclusion: Test case prioritization has already been considerably discussed in the software testing domain. However, it is commonly learned that there are quite a number of existing prioritization techniques that can still be improved especially in data used and execution process for each approach.},

Efficiency can be obtained by optimizing the test cases as it provides a balance between the safety and precision. Many optimization techniques from various domains have been applied in regression testing for optimizing the search and the solutions. But nature-inspired algorithms are gaining more popularity now a days as the algorithms are more efficient for complex problems. In this paper, we have explored the research work done by various researchers on regression testing using natureinspired approaches. It is found that biology inspired computation e.g. genetic algorithm have been widely used in regression testing optimization with the intent of maximizing fault or code coverage in minimum time. It is also concluded that nature-inspired approaches have great potential to optimize regression testing problems.},

@article{bajaj_systematic_2019,
	abstract = {Regression testing is the essential process of software maintenance and evolution phase of the software development life cycle for assuring the quality and reliability of updated software. Test case prioritization is the technique of regression testing to reduce the time and effort required for regression testing. Search-based algorithms are used to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the method. Among these search-based optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms are becoming more popular among researchers since the last decade. In this paper, we are doing a systematic literature review, i.e., a secondary study of test case prioritization using genetic algorithms. The objective of this review is to examine and classify the current state of use of the genetic algorithm in test case prioritization. In other words, to give a base for the advancement of test case prioritization research using genetic algorithms. With the use of the systematic literature review protocol, we selected the most relevant studies (20 out of 384) from the appropriate repositories by using a set of search keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria and the quality assessment of studies. The data extraction and synthesis process and the taxonomic classification are used to answer the research questions. We also performed a rigorous analysis of the techniques by comparing them on research methodology, the prioritization method, dataset specification, test suite size, types of genetic algorithms used, performance metrics, and the validation criteria. The whole process took four months for comprehensive analysis and classification of primary studies. We observed that the parameter settings, the type of operators, the probabilistic rate of operators, and fitness function design have a significant impact on the quality of the solutions obtained. This systematic literature review yields that genetic algorithms have great potential in solving test case prioritization problems, and the area is open for further improvements. Future researchers can fill the research gaps by following the suggestions given in the review. From this review, we found that the use of the appropriate approach can make a genetic algorithm based test case prioritization one of the effective methods in regression testing.},

	abstract = {Software systems and their environment change are continuous. They are enhanced, corrected, and ported to new platforms. These changes can affect a system adversely, thus software engineers perform regression testing to ensure the quality of the modified systems. Regression testing is an integral part of most major software projects, but as projects grow larger and the number of tests increases, performing regression testing becomes more costly. To address this problem, many researchers and practitioners have proposed and empirically evaluated various regression testing techniques, such as regression test selection, test case prioritization, and test suite minimization. Recent surveys on these techniques indicate that this research area continues to grow, heuristics and the types of data utilized become diverse, and wider application domains have been considered. This chapter presents the current status and the trends of three regression testing techniques and discusses recent advances of each technique.},

	abstract = {Test Case Prioritization (TCP) involves the rearrangement of test cases on a prioritized basis for various services. This research work focuses on TCP in web services, as it has been a growing challenge for researchers. Web services continuously evolve and hence require reforming and re-execution of test cases to ensure the accurate working of web services. This study aims to investigate gaps, issues, and existing solutions related to test case prioritization. This study examines research publications within popular selected databases. We perform a meticulous screening of research publications and selected 65 papers through which to answer the proposed research questions. The results show that criteria-based test case prioritization techniques are reported mainly in 41 primary studies. Test case prioritization models, frameworks, and related algorithms are also reported in primary studies. In addition, there are eight issues related to TCP techniques. Among these eight issues, optimization and high effectiveness are most discussed within primary studies. This systematic review has identified that a significant proportion of primary studies are not involved in the use of statistical methods in measuring or comparing the effectiveness of TCP techniques. However, a large number of primary studies use `Average Percentage of Faults Detected' (APFD) or extended APFD metrics to compute the performance of techniques for web services.},

In this chapter, we perform an extensive survey and analysis on existing test-case prioritization techniques, as well as pointing out future directions for test-case prioritization. More specifically, we collect 191 papers on test-case prioritization from 1997 to 2016 and conduct a detailed survey to systematically investigate these work from six aspects, i.e., algorithms, criteria, measurements, constraints, empirical studies, and scenarios. For each of the six aspects, we discuss the existing work and the trend during the evolution of test-case prioritization. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations/issues in test-case prioritization research, as well as potential future directions on test-case prioritization. Our analyses provide the evidence that test-case prioritization topic is attracting increasing interests, while the need for practical test-case prioritization tools remains.},

While Regression Test Selection (RTS) discards test cases and Test Suite Minimization (TSM) shows diminution in fault detection rate, Test Case Prioritization (TCP) does not discard test cases. Test Case Prioritization techniques can be coverage or historical information based or model based. It can also be cost-time aware or requirementrisk aware. GUI/Web applications need special prioritization mechanism. In this paper, 90 scholarly articles ranging from 2001 to 2018 have been reviewed. We have explored IEEE, Wiley, ACM Library, Springer, Taylor \& Francis and Elsevier database. We have also described each prioritization method with their findings and subject programs. This paper includes a chronological catalogue listing of the reviewed papers. We have framed three research questions which sum up the frequently used prioritization metrics, regularly used subject programs and the distribution of different prioritization techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review with a detail report of the last 18 years of TCP techniques. We hope this article will be beneficial for both beginners and seasoned professionals.},

@article{rehman_khan_systematic_2018,
	abstract = {Regression testing aims at testing a system under test (SUT) in the presence of changes. As a SUT changes, the number of test cases increases to handle the modifications, and ultimately, it becomes practically impossible to execute all of them within limited testing budget. Test suite reduction (TSR) approaches are widely used to improve the regression testing costs by selecting representative test suite without compromising effectiveness, such as fault-detection capability, within allowed time budget. The aim of this systematic review is to identify state-of-the-art TSR approaches categories, assess the quality of experiments reported on this subject, and provide a set of guidelines for conducting future experiments in this area of research. After applying a two-facet study selection procedure, we finalized 113 most relevant studies from an initial pool of 4230 papers published in the field of TSR between 1993 and 2016. The TSR approaches are broadly classified into four main categories based on the literature including greedy, clustering, search, and hybrid approaches. It is noted that majority of the experiments in TSR do not follow any specific guidelines for planning, conducting, and reporting the experiments, which may pose validity threats related to their results. Thus, we recommend conducting experiments that are better designed for the future. In this direction, an initial set of recommendations is provided that are useful for performing welldesigned experiments in the field of TSR. Furthermore, we provide a number of future research directions based on current trends in this field of research.},

	abstract = {Software regression testing techniques verify previous functionalities each time software modifications occur or new characteristics are added. With the aim of gaining a better understanding of this subject, in this work we present a survey of software regression testing techniques applied in the last 15 years; taking into account its application domain, kind of metrics they use, its application strategies and the phase of the software development process where they are applied. From an outcome of 460 papers, a set of 25 papers describing the use of 31 software testing regression techniques were identified. Results of this survey suggest that at the time of applying a regression testing techniques, metrics like cost and fault detection efficiency are the most relevant. Most of the techniques were assessed with instrumented programs (experimental cases) under academic settings. Conversely, we observe a minimum set of software regression techniques applied in industrial settings, mainly, under corrective and maintenance approaches. Finally, we observe a trend using some regression techniques under agile approaches. {\copyright} 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},
