The group of papers discussed in \Cref{chap:literature_review} is just the initial contents of the live repository that is made available online.
Over time, through updates to the review and submissions by authors, we expect this list to grow.


\section{Summary}
Finally, as the paper title indicates, this review is conceived
as a \textit{live} systematic review\footnote{We notice that our concept of a ``live'' systematic review, while inspired by similar aims, should not be confused with the much more formalized approach for conducting \textit{living systematic reviews} recently adopted in medicine, as illustrated by \url{https://community.cochrane.org/review-production/production-resources/living-systematic-reviews}.}. 
In our analysis of recent secondary studies, we noticed that a gap of one or even two years elapses between the covered period of literature and the year the review appears. 
This is understandable because the authors  may need substantial time for analyzing the selected studies and then writing the article, and then several months will typically be taken for the peer reviewing process. 
Moreover, even if this temporal gap is reduced to a minimum, as long as the investigated topic remains active, new primary studies will always appear, soon distancing any SLR from the status of literature.  
If the purpose of a SLR is to provide an up-to-date summary of existing work on a topic, frequent updates are required to include newly appearing relevant studies.
Also, it can happen that the original research questions and findings lose relevance, or are superseded by newer results.
As previously questioned in other disciplines~\cite{Garneri3507}, Mendes et al.~\cite{MENDES2020110607} have recently investigated the issue of SLRs in SE becoming obsolete and of when and how they would  need to be updated. 
Specifically, in line with~\cite{Garneri3507}, they conclude that SLRs should be updated based on two conditions: \textit{i)} new relevant methods, studies or information become available; or \textit{ii)} the adoption or inclusion of previous and new research cause an impact to the findings, conclusions or credibility of the original SLR.
In consideration of these challenges, rather than providing a static repository of the studies found while conducting the review, together with the article we release an \textit{open and updatable repository}, which is an integral part of this review work.
 
The intent is to invite the community to contribute with 
newly published works that are relevant in \rea approaches to \rt, or even with works published in the period we cover but that for some reason escaped our selection.
This will allow us not only to keep track of newly published studies, 
but also to recover papers with purely theoretical motivations that eventually provided benefits in practice.
At periodic intervals (planned to be once per year), we will check new results for queries and suggestions from the community and decide how to update the collection of studies.

\section{The Repository}
Literature reviews provide important information to researchers starting out in a field or practitioners who are curious to know the latest innovations, but do not have time to fully explore journals and conferences.
However, it is inevitable that a literature review such as this becomes outdated after some time, as new research comes out that cannot be included in the published paper.
This of course limits the long-term value of the work, since the text will no longer reflect the ongoing research in the field.

In order to aggregate long-term value to this work, we have made the list of papers and the information extracted from them available as an online live repository\footnote{Available at: \url{https://renangreca.github.io/literature-repository}.}.
The papers in \Cref{table:selected} serve as the starting point for a list that will continue to grow year over year.
We hope this website will serve as reference to anyone who is interested in practical applications of regression testing techniques in the coming years.

The main challenge is how to keep this repository alive in the long term.
It is unfeasible for us to add a relevant paper to the repository as soon as it is published, so our plan is to update the list in a yearly basis, re-running the query and screening steps detailed in \Cref{sec:methodology}.
That way, we can at least assure the most recent paper included is no more than one year old.
We are also looking into the possibility of getting automatic notifications when a paper that satisfies certain criteria is published in an online library.
For now, this work is done by the original authors of the literature review; according to future necessities, we will appoint other researchers or graduate students to help with the process.
In addition, we also encourage authors to submit their own work by filling a form linked on the website.

The repository also contains a separate section for relevant literature reviews.
This is initially populated by the reviews mentioned in \Cref{sec:related} and, upon publication, this very document.
With this we aim to provide a starting point for new researchers and a place to gather the overarching themes of the field.

It can also happen that, over the years, the definitions we selected for including a paper in the repository must be adjusted.
Whenever an author submits a paper, we will use the opportunity to consider whether or not the paper itself is a good fit for the repository, but also if there are new trends that our existing selection process does not account for.
There will likely be a point in the future when the industry/academia landscape has shifted and this study will no longer be needed.
When that happens, we will discuss the possibility of freezing the repository and stopping further expansions.

Aside from newer papers, it is always possible that we have missed some relevant papers for a variety of reasons, so the live repository is another way of mitigating that risk.
It is impossible to provide a complete and definitive overview of any field, but we believe that a live repository is the closest approximation that can be expected.
