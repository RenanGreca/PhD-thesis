\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:ind_rqs}

The following research questions represent the main objectives of the collaborative interaction with Ericsson.
Generally, the contribution of this period is the identification and explanation of notable challenges involved with industry-academia collaboration and the advancement of practical software testing techniques.

Keep in mind these are not the questions asked directly to the practitioners (these are found in \autoref{app:surveys}), but they were used a starting point to design the interviews.

\paragraph{RQ\ref{chap:industry}.1.} What are the issues most frequently noted by software testing practitioners?
\paragraph{RQ\ref{chap:industry}.2.} What are the challenges that arise when trying to incorporate academic insight in practice?
\paragraph{RQ\ref{chap:industry}.3.} What are potential paths to improve collaboration between academics and practitioners?
\todo{Note: The RQs are 5.x because this is chapter 5 of the thesis, it appears as ch.1 because I've omitted the others}
%How can academics make their work more accessible for interested practitioners?
