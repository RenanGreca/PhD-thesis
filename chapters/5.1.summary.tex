\section{Summary}\label{sec:ind_summary}

It is well-known that not many ideas proposed in academia make their way into practical usage.

Recently, there has been research specifically about the ``Industry-academia gap''.

In this paper, we aim to bring more light into this topic by drawing some comparisons between points frequently discussed in the literature and the actual state of practice in an industrial partner.

Section \ref{sec:background} gives some background on regression testing. Section \ref{sec:rqs} contains the research questions and their discussions. Section \ref{sec:related} highlights relevant related work. Section \ref{sec:threats} points potential threats to the validity of this study. Finally, \ref{sec:conclusion} offers our closing thoughts.
