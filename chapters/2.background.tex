Some core concepts form the basis of the discussion found in this thesis.
In particular, the focus is on regression testing (\rt) techniques for continuously evolving software.
Collectively, we view \rt techniques as parts of an overarching test suite orchestration strategy.
%Regression testing is widely studied within the software engineering research.
This chapter provides a brief introduction to these concepts, including additional details on the specific \rt challenges that are tackled in this research.
