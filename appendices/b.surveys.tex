Dear \{\{Name\}\},

I am Renan Greca, a PhD student at the Gran Sasso Science Institute, under the supervision of Professors Antonia Bertolino and Breno Miranda. Currently, we are performing a systematic literature review on the topic of software regression testing, focusing on the real-world relevance and applicability of techniques proposed in academia.

The following paper(s) of your authorship has(have) been selected for our study:

\{\{Paper 1\}\}\\
\{\{Paper 2\}\}\\
\{\{Paper 3\}\}\\

If possible, we would like some information about the outcome of your research after the publication of the paper(s). We have a few questions regarding your work:

\textbf{1. Is there a functional version of your technique (tool, prototype, source code, etc.) available online? If so, please share with us the URL.}

\textbf{2. Was there an attempt to implement your technique in industrial or large open-source software? Is the technique currently in use with the software?}

\textbf{3. If the technique was put into practice, were the metrics used in the paper relevant for the technique’s applicability? If not, were there other metrics that proved to be useful?}

Furthermore, please let us know whether we can link your comments directly to your work in our literature review or, if not, if we can mention these comments without referencing which author gave them.

Finally, please inform us if you are interested and available for further contact related to the outcome of this research at a later date.

We kindly ask you to provide answers by September 23, or to let us know by then if more time is needed.

If you have received a similar email before, it is because we are updating our study and we have included another paper from your authorship, so please respond regarding these new paper(s).

Best regards,

Renan Greca (GSSI)\\
Breno Miranda (UFPE)\\
Antonia Bertolino (ISTI-CNR)\\

\textbf{1} & \textbf{Survey for software testing practitioners}

We are researchers studying the state of collaboration between academic researchers and industrial practitioners, considering the topic of software regression testing. This survey has the goal of better understanding practitioners' perspective on past and ongoing usage of methods, techniques and tools initially developed in an academic context.

Fill this form if you are directly or indirectly involved with software testing at the company you work for. If you have colleagues that also work with software testing, please share the form with them.

Please submit your responses by {{deadline}}.

By answering these questions, you provide consent to the authors to handle this data and use it for research purposes. The data will not be used for any other purposes.

If you have questions or need clarifications, feel free to contact the authors:
Antonia Bertolino (antonia.bertolino@isti.cnr.it)
Breno Miranda (bafm@ufpe.br)
Renan Greca (renan.greca@gssi.it) \\

\textbf{1.1} & \textbf{Please tell us what are the most common pain points when it comes to running regression testing suites.}

\textit{Multiple choices can be selected.}

a) Detecting failures

b) Flaky (unreliable) tests 

c) Running time of the test suite

d) Creating new tests or updating existing ones

e) Cleaning up obsolete tests 

Other... \\

\textbf{1.2} & \textbf{Do you know of, or have you used, any tool for improving regression testing with roots in academic research?}

By regression testing, we mean running and re-running tests that cover previously-existing functionality. Examples of techniques that can help are test case selection, test case prioritization, test suite augmentation or test suite reduction.

\textit{A single choice can be selected.}

a) I have used one or more tools. (go to Section 2)

b) I know about one or more, but never used them. (go to Section 3)

c) I don't know about these tools. (go to Section 4) \\
